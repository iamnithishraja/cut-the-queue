Here's a README template for the `http` folder that explains how to set up and run the code for HTTP requests, as well as the build steps and required dependencies.

# HTTP Folder - HTTP Request Code

This folder contains code for handling HTTP requests in your application. It provides a set of utilities and constants, along with other required logic to make HTTP requests.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, you need to set up and build the necessary components. Follow these steps carefully:

### 1. Set Up and Build Everything in the Packages Folder

Ensure that everything inside the `packages` folder is built first. This includes client generation and setting up Prisma, among other components. The build process for each package in `packages` may vary, so be sure to follow the specific setup instructions for each package.

### 2. Generate Client and Prisma Setup

1. Navigate to the package where the Prisma client is located.
2. Run the necessary commands to generate the client. For example:

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

This ensures that Prisma is properly set up and the client is generated.

### 3. Build Utilities (`utils`)

Next, you need to build the `utils` package. This package may contain utility functions required by your HTTP code.

```bash
npm run build
```

This will compile and prepare the `utils` package for use.

### 4. Build Constants (`constants`)

The `constants` package contains values that are essential for your HTTP request logic. Build it as well by running:

```bash
npm run build
```

Ensure that your `.env` file is loaded properly before proceeding with the build step. This is important for any environment variables to be correctly loaded into your application.

## Setting Up the HTTP Request Service

Once all the necessary packages are built, follow these steps to run the HTTP request service.

### 1. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have installed all dependencies for the project:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Make sure your `.env` file is correctly set up with all required environment variables. You may need to configure database URLs, API keys, or other environment-specific settings.

### 3. Running the Development Server

To run the development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server using `nodemon`, which will automatically restart the server upon file changes.

### 4. Starting the Server in Production

To start the server in a production environment, first build the project and then run the compiled code:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

This will start the server using the compiled JavaScript files from the `dist` folder.



## Available Scripts

- **`npm run test`**: Runs the test suite (currently not set up).
- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the server in development mode with `nodemon`.
- **`npm run start`**: Starts the production server after building the project.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the project, compiles TypeScript to JavaScript, and copies necessary assets to the `dist` folder.

---

By following these steps, you should be able to run and modify the HTTP request service smoothly. If you encounter any issues, make sure that all necessary services, environment variables, and dependencies are properly configured.
