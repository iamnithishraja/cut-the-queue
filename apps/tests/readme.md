# LoadTest

## Overview
The LoadTest utility helps to simulate traffic on a web service to evaluate its performance under heavy load. By using this tool, you can determine how well your application handles different levels of requests, identify potential bottlenecks, and ensure that your system remains stable under stress.

## Why It's Important
Load testing is critical for identifying performance issues before they impact real users. This tool allows you to:

- Simulate large amounts of traffic to your service.
- Measure response times and server performance.
- Pinpoint system weaknesses and improve scalability.

## Scripts

- **test**: The default test script, which is currently a placeholder and doesnâ€™t perform any operations. It can be customized for specific tests in the future.
  ```json
  "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  ```

- **loadTest**: This script runs the load testing process using `nodemon` to automatically restart the script during development. It executes the `loadtest.ts` script located in the `src` folder.
  ```json
  "loadTest": "npx nodemon ./src/loadtest.ts"
  ```

This `loadtest.ts` script is where you define the parameters and logic for the load test (e.g., the number of virtual users, request intervals, and the target endpoints).

Use the provided scripts to run load tests and monitor your system's response under various conditions.
